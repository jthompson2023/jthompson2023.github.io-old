I once watched Salman Khan’s TED talk (one of several, actually), and he and I think very much alike in our visions for education. Small wonder it’s been such an asset!Khan Academy has tons of videos and practice questions, but the best thing about using it is the choice of pace. If I start watching one of the videos and I get the concept right of the bat, I don’t have to slog through a bunch of content that isn’t helpful to me - I can do some practice and move to the next thing. If I’m really struggling to understand something, I don’t have to race to catch up - I can delve deep into their video archives and take the time to make sure I understand things. Pacing has been the biggest game-changer in Pilot as a whole, and I’m really grateful for the opportunity to set my own.How I use Khan AcademyIn my experience, Khan Academy videos usually fall into one of two categories: Instruction videos introduce new concepts, techniques, and proofs. I usually watch these through all the way, then take down notes on all the new stuff I learned. I don’t usually have to refer back to these notes very often - it’s the process of taking quality, explanatory notes that helps me. Worked example videos pose practice problems and situations in which to use the stuff we learn in instruction videos, and work through how to solve the problems. As Sal encourages, I always pause the video and try to work out my own answers to the problems first, then watch how he does it and take note of any mistakes I made in the process. Khan Academy also has practice problems and tests for all this stuff, though I’ve been supplementing them with problems from CK-12 as well: ck12Below are some progress screenshots of that work. I haven’t been all that focused on Khan Academy’s “mastery system” so far, because I’ve mostly been working through the content for one big unit:composite functionstrigonometry" }, { "title": "Spaced Repetition", "url": "/posts/spaced-rep/", "categories": "", "tags": "US-history, statistics, precalculus", "date": "2022-01-12 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "I used to hate memorization. Now I think it’s a critical part of learning.Why?The problem was that, in all my previous learning experience, I’d never really seen memorization used right. With notebooks and calculators available to us, memorization really just seemed like an arbitrary standard for tests - ‘remember and regurgitate’ and all that. It seemed like a lot of effort for very little return on investment. After all, aren’t critical thinking and creativity much more important?Of course those skills matter, and really ought to be given more emphasis in our grading systems. But memorization and learning aren’t diametrically opposed. How can you write a novel if you don’t know any words? How can you make smart judgments if you don’t have a good mental model in your head? Memory is a toolkit and a library for critical thinking, and when memorization is used rightly, it can let you expand that library and shelve away new knowledge without worrying about decay.How do I use it ‘rightly’?Following a pretty substantial cognitive science literature, I use a method called ‘spaced repetition’ for learning things long term. Spaced repetition follows a pretty basic structure: Break down everything you want to remember into a bunch of little flashcards that hold 1 fact each. Review and add to your flashcards every day, but… After you successfully review a certain set of cards, give it a longer pause before reviewing again, so each fact is reviewed with increasing intervals between them. If you fail a card, it goes back to the beginning of the process.This works, and it works really well. I can still remember exactly how signals are sent between neurons, how inhibitory, excitatory, and neuromodulatory signals are sent, and what basic characteristics all neurotransmitters share, from a book I read six months ago. I used to use physical flashcards for this, but now I use the spaced repetition app Anki along with my usual notes.If you’re curious about this system, there’s no better way to learn about this than the interactive article that got me started on spaced repetition here… which you should really really read when you get the chance.DocumentationThankfully, Anki allows you to export your notes as plaintext, so I have my Pilot-related spaced repetition cards in a Google Doc for your perusal. Just skimming through them should give you a general idea of the process.

This meant essay writing was slower-going than it normally would be, but leads to (I think) higher quality. It’s been inspired by the very reference-heavy nonfiction I’ve been reading recently - Behave, These Truths, and (somewhat contentiously) The Better Angels of Our Nature.Link to the essay is here, and link to the outline is here.

Published in 2018, it’s the most recent complete, back-to-front political history of the United States of America, and an extensively researched one at that - roughly ten percent of its 900 pages are purely citations and references.The processWhen I read this book, I work in a three-step process: The first read. I go through a chapter without worrying much about fact retention, just to get an overview of what’s important and what isn’t. I used to get obsessed with noting down every single detail and took too long, so this helps me clarify what’s needed. Read &amp;amp; sticky note. Then I go through again and leave little sticky note flags over sections that I think are noteworthy and want to remember, which leads into… Ankify! I’m a big fan of Anki and the spaced repetition system for remembering the stuff that I learn long-term. I go into more detail on my post about how I use it here, but the gist of things is that I make the important facts and concepts into very small, simple digital notecards that I review to keep those truths in mind.How it’s goingI’ve covered the first main segment of the book, from first European landfall in 1492 to the election of 1800. That doesn’t sound like a lot for being halfway done with a study in US History, but I’ve spend a lot of time on external research projects relating to the essay about justification of beliefs that I’m working on. Next semester, since I’ve had my fun with lots of external research, I’ll concentrate on making my way through the book at a steadier pace, and plan to finish it by the end of the year!" }, { "title": "Notebook Pages", "url": "/posts/notes/", "categories": "", "tags": "statistics, precalculus, US-history", "date": "2022-01-03 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "I keep all of my notes for all of my classes in one notebook.

Below, you can see: my source code for the experiment, written myself in Python my preregistration document where I wrote down what experiments I was going to do before I did them, so I wasn’t tempted to change them if the results didn’t turn out (real scientists do this too!) my analysis document where I analyzed the results of those experiments my synthesis document where I merged both of those for ease of documentation.
