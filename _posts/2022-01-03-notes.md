I keep all of my notes for all of my classes in one notebook. It makes for less to carry, less wasted space, and more places where I can see the connections between my different fields of work, and because of [my spaced repetition system](PLACEHOLDER), I don't need to refer back to them that often once I've written them down.

However, I recognize that that is *quite a pain* for all the lovely folks who need to grade my documented work, so I've scanned the notes and separated them into PDFs by subject matter and quarter:

- **Statistics:** [Q1](PLACEHOLDER), [Q2](PLACEHOLDER)
- **Precalc:** [Q1](PLACEHOLDER), [Q2](PLACEHOLDER)
- **US History:** [Q1](PLACEHOLDER), [Q2](PLACEHOLDER)
