title:  Reading These Truths by Jill Lepore
tags: US-history
---

As a guide in my US History study this year, I've been reading *These Truths: a History of the United States* by Jill Lepore, Harvard professor of American History and staff writer for the New Yorker. Published in 2018, it's the most recent complete, back-to-front political history of the United States of America, and an extensively researched one at that - roughly ten percent of its 900 pages are purely citations and references.

## The process

When I read this book, I work in a three-step process:
1. *The first read.* I go through a chapter without worrying much about fact retention, just to get an overview of what's important and what isn't. I used to get obsessed with noting down every single detail and took too long, so this helps me clarify what's needed.
2. *Read & sticky note.* Then I go through again and leave little sticky note flags over sections that I think are noteworthy and want to remember, which leads into...
3. *Ankify!* I'm a big fan of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) and the spaced repetition system for remembering the stuff that I learn long-term. I go into more detail on my post about how I use it [here]({{site.baseurl}}), but the gist of things is that I make the important facts and concepts into very small, simple digital notecards that I review to keep those truths in mind.

## How it's going

I've covered the first main segment of the book, from first European landfall in 1492 to the election of 1800. That doesn't sound like a lot for being halfway done with a study in US History, but I've spend a lot of time on external research projects relating to the [essay]({{site.baseurl}}) about justification of beliefs that I'm working on.

Next semester, since I've had my fun with lots of external research, I'll concentrate on making my way through the book at a steadier pace, and plan to finish it by the end of the year!
