title:  JUSTIFICATION - an essay in progress
tags: US-history
---

To summarize the learning I did from [reading These Truths](../these-truths) and the [notes](../notes) I've taken on persuasion and human psychology, I've been writing an essay about justification of beliefs - why we justify and how we unconsciously distort the facts to serve our needs.

In the writing process, I really wanted to emphasize extensive use of citations, to build my case out of verifiable chunks of information, rather than citing "common knowledge" and making assumptions about what's true. This meant essay writing was slower-going than it normally would be, but leads to (I think) higher quality. It's been inspired by the very reference-heavy nonfiction I've been reading recently - [Behave](https://www.indiebound.org/buy-local/9780143110910), [These Truths](https://www.indiebound.org/buy-local/9780393357424), and (somewhat contentiously) [The Better Angels of Our Nature](https://www.indiebound.org/buy-local/9780143122012).
