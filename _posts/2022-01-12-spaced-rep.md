I used to hate memorization. Now I think it's a critical part of learning.

## Why?

The problem was that, in all my previous learning experience, I'd never really seen memorization used *right*. With notebooks and calculators available to us, memorization really just seemed like an arbitrary standard for tests - 'remember and regurgitate' and all that. It seemed like a lot of effort for very little return on investment. After all, aren't critical thinking and creativity much more important?

Of course those skills matter, and really ought to be given more emphasis in our grading systems. But memorization and learning aren't diametrically opposed. How can you write a novel if you don't know any words? How can you make smart judgments if you don't have a good mental model in your head? Memory is a toolkit and a library for critical thinking, and when memorization is used rightly, it can let you expand that library and shelve away new knowledge without worrying about decay.

## How do I use it 'rightly'?

Following a pretty substantial cognitive science literature, I use a method called 'spaced repetition' for learning things long term. Spaced repetition follows a pretty basic structure:
1. Break down everything you want to remember into a bunch of little flashcards that hold 1 fact each.
2. Review and add to your flashcards every day, but...
3. After you successfully review a certain set of cards, give it a *longer* pause before reviewing again, so each fact is reviewed with *increasing* intervals between them.
4. If you fail a card, it goes back to the beginning of the process.

This works, and it works really well. I can still remember exactly how signals are sent between neurons, how inhibitory, excitatory, and neuromodulatory signals are sent, and what basic characteristics all neurotransmitters share, from a book I read six months ago. I used to use physical flashcards for this, but now I use the spaced repetition app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) along with my usual notes.

If you're curious about this system, there's no better way to learn about this than the interactive article that got *me* started on spaced repetition [here](https://ncase.me/remember)... *which you should __really really__ read when you get the chance.*

## Documentation

Thankfully, Anki allows you to export your notes as plaintext, so I have my Pilot-related spaced repetition cards in a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1eP2y7uT5d6XcDueRFLeF5r9-XUpjbcoSQsvYdaYNk/edit?usp=sharing) for your perusal. Just skimming through them should give you a general idea of the process. Don't hesitate to contact me with questions!
