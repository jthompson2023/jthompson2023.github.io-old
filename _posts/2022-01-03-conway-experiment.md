title:  Conway's Game of Life Experiment
tags: statistics
---

Last year, I spent a good chunk of my project in economics programming simulations and conducting experiments. This year, I thought I'd continue that trend for statistics, and use the new statistical tools I'd been learning to analyze those experiments more rigorously.

I spent this first semester working on an experiment about [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) - modifying the rules, trying different scenarios, and observing the effects on the lifeforms that grow there. Below, you can see:
- my [source code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wnsAl-1k8_f5VdnzyZ_uYo-Py3e5o-sA?usp=sharing) for the experiment, written myself in Python
- my [preregistration document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVpI34kQiUMSKFggwn8IrvW9dOovFgID0obSTPVRNuA/edit?usp=sharing) where I wrote down what experiments I was going to do *before* I did them, so I wasn't tempted to change them if the results didn't turn out (real scientists do this too!)
- my [analysis document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCDSyTzAqj_l1ciZQTs1Kj8xVUbfm2gp2zcsngZ1Teg/edit?usp=sharing) where I analyzed the results of those experiments
- my [synthesis document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBgKTRbf3LMEuc821vnaGKhc63xwvAqzshqdJSQ6HH8/edit?usp=sharing) where I merged both of those for ease of documentation. *This is the most important one!*

Enjoy!
