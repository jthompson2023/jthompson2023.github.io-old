For all of my Pilot work in the year-and-a-half I've been doing it, Khan Academy has been a godsend. I once watched Salman Khan's [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA) (one of several, actually), and he and I think very much alike in our visions for education. Small wonder it's been such an asset!

Khan Academy has tons of videos and practice questions, but the best thing about using it is the choice of pace. If I start watching one of the videos and I get the concept right of the bat, I don't have to slog through a bunch of content that isn't helpful to me - I can do some practice and move to the next thing. If I'm really struggling to understand something, I don't have to race to catch up - I can delve deep into their video archives and take the time to make sure I understand things. Pacing has been the biggest game-changer in Pilot as a whole, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity to set my own.

## How I use Khan Academy

In my experience, Khan Academy videos usually fall into one of two categories:

1. __Instruction__ videos introduce new concepts, techniques, and proofs. I usually watch these through all the way, then take down [notes](../notes) on all the new stuff I learned. I don't usually have to refer back to these notes very often - it's the process of taking quality, explanatory notes that helps me.

2. __Worked example__ videos pose practice problems and situations in which to use the stuff we learn in instruction videos, and work through how to solve the problems. As Sal encourages, I always pause the video and try to work out my own answers to the problems first, then watch how he does it and take note of any mistakes I made in the process. Khan Academy also has practice problems and tests for all this stuff, though I've been supplementing them with problems from [CK-12](https://www.ck12.org/assessment/ui/build-20211220180129/browse/practice/) as well:

Below are some progress screenshots of that work. I haven't been all that focused on Khan Academy's "mastery system" so far, because I've mostly been working through the content for one big unit:
