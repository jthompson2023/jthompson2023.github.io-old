I once watched Salman Khan’s TED talk (one of several, actually), and he and I think very much alike in our visions for education. Small wonder it’s been such an asset! Khan Academy has tons of videos and practice questions, but the best thing about using it is the choice of pace. If I start ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Spaced Repetition</title><link href="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/spaced-rep/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spaced Repetition" /><published>2022-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-01-13T19:45:07+00:00</updated> <id>https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/spaced-rep/</id> <content src="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/spaced-rep/" /> <author> <name>Jack</name> </author> <summary> I used to hate memorization. Now I think it’s a critical part of learning. Why? The problem was that, in all my previous learning experience, I’d never really seen memorization used right. With notebooks and calculators available to us, memorization really just seemed like an arbitrary standard for tests - ‘remember and regurgitate’ and all that. It seemed like a lot of effort for very little... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>JUSTIFICATION - an essay in progress</title><link href="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/justification/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JUSTIFICATION - an essay in progress" /><published>2022-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-01-13T19:45:07+00:00</updated> <id>https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/justification/</id> <content src="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/justification/" /> <author> <name>Jack</name> </author> <summary> To summarize the learning I did from reading These Truths and the notes I’ve taken on persuasion and human psychology, I’ve been writing an essay about justification of beliefs - why we justify and how we unconsciously distort the facts to serve our needs. In the writing process, I really wanted to emphasize extensive use of citations, to build my case out of verifiable chunks of information, ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reading These Truths by Jill Lepore</title><link href="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/these-truths/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reading These Truths by Jill Lepore" /><published>2022-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-01-13T19:45:07+00:00</updated> <id>https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/these-truths/</id> <content src="https://jthompson2023.github.io/posts/these-truths/" /> <author> <name>Jack</name> </author> <summary> As a guide in my US History study this year, I’ve been reading These Truths: a History of the United States by Jill Lepore, Harvard professor of American History and staff writer for the New Yorker. Published in 2018, it’s the most recent complete, back-to-front political history of the United States of America, and an extensively researched one at that - roughly ten percent of its 900 pages ar... </summary> </entry> </feed>
